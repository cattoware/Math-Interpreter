# Math-Interpreter
This is a math 'interpreter' I just made today, it can calculates complex maths. I am working to add more supports and make this into a gui in the future!
Also I am learning lexer so I made this calculator using this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh49BXmHxX8
I also made configs inside configs.py

To use this simply run main.py and then give it some maths!
